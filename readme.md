# CUDA Accelerated Ray Tracing Engine
This is a CUDA based Ray Tracing Engine.


### Usage
Clone this repo and run make to compile.
Use ffmpeg to compile the frames.

### Current Capabilities
The engine can currently be used to simulate geometric objects with material types like Lambertian, metal, dielectric and diffuse light.

### Requirements
Ensure CUDA toolkit 11.1 is used for compilation.
### TODO
1. Implement monte carlo optimization.
2. Use trianglar meshes instead of equations.


### Motivation
Im creating this project to get more familiar with ray-tracing.
